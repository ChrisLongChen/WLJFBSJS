### T27
(a) In the second paragraph from host A to B, the sequence number is 207, the source port number is 302, and the destination port number is 80.

(b) If the first paragraph arrives before the second arriving paragraph, in the confirmation of the first arriving paragraph, the confirmation number is 207, the source port number is 80, and the destination port number is 302.

(c) If the second segment arrives before the first segment, in the confirmation of the first arriving segment, the confirmation number is 127, indicating that it is still waiting for bytes 127 and beyond.

### T46
(a) Let w represent the maximum window size measured in the segment.   w * ms / RTT = 10Mbps.  
If the maximum sending rate exceeds the link, the packet is discarded.So we have w * 1500 * 8/0.15 = 10 * 10  
We get w is about 125 segments.

(b) When the crowded window size varies between W/2 and W. Average window size 0.75W = 94(upper limit 93.75).  
The average throughput is 94 * 1500 * 8/0.15=7.52Mbps

(c) When the packet is lost, W becomes W/2, or 125/2=62. (125-62)*0.15=9.45s.   
Because the number of RTT (this TCP connection increases its window size from 62 to 125) is 63. The size of each RTT window increases by one

### T51
(a) According to the table calculation, after 2200 milliseconds, the window sizes of C1 and C2 are the same.  
| time (seconds)| Window size the number of segments sent in the next 100 milliseconds | data sending speed (segment per second =Window/0.1)| data sending speed (segment per second =Window/0.1)| data sending speed (segment per second =Window/0.1)|  
|0| 15 |150 (in [0-100]msec]| 10 |100 (in [0-100]msec) |
|100 |7| 70| 5| 50 |  
|200| 3| 30| 2 |20 |  
|300| 1 |10| 1 |10 |  
|400 |2| 20 |2 |20 |  
|500| 1 |10 |1| 10 |  
|600 |2 |20 |2| 20 |  
|700 |1 |10 |1 |10 |  
|800 |2 |20 |2 |20 |  
|900 |1 |10 |1 |10 |  
|1000 |2| 20 |2| 20 |  
|1100 |1 |10 |1 |10 |  
|1200 |2 |20 |2| 20 |  
|1300| 1 |10 |1 |10 |  
|1400 |2 |20 |2| 20 |  
|1500 |1 |10 |1| 10 |  
|1600 |2 |20| 2 |20 |  
|1700 |1 |10 |1 |10 |  
|1800 |2 |20| 2 |20 |  
|1900 |1 |10 |1 |10 |  
|2000 |2 |20 |2| 20 |  
|2100 |1| 10 |1 |10 |  
|2200| 2 |20| 2| 20 |

(b) Yes, this is due to TCP's AIMD algorithm, and the two connections have the same RTT.

(c) Yes, you can see it clearly from the table above. Their maximum window size is 2.

(d) No, this synchronization will not improve link utilization, because the two connections act as a single connection oscillation between the minimum window and the maximum window size.As a result, the link is underutilized.  
One possible way to interrupt synchronization is to add a limited buffer to the link and drop packets randomly into the buffer before the buffer overflows. This causes different connections to reduce their window size at different times.
