# Network distributed computing the seventh homework
## Exercise
### T2
(a)No, only one packet can be sent on the Shared bus at a time. 

(b)No, as stated in the text, memory can only be read/written to the shared system bus once at a time.

(c)No, in this case, both packets must be sent on the same output bus at the same time, which is impossible.

### T5
(a)|Prefix Matching|Link Interface|  
|11100000 00|0|  
|11100000 01000000|1|  
|1110000|2|  
|11100001 1|3|  
|Otherwise|3|  

(b)The prefix match for first address is 5<sup>th</sup> entry: link interface 3.  
The prefix match for second address is 3<sup>nd</sup> entry: link interface 2.  
The prefix match for third address is 4<sup>th</sup> entry: link interface 3.

### T6
|Destination Address Range|Link Interface|  
|00000000 through 00111111|0|  
|01000000 through 01011111|1|  
|01100000 through 01111111|2|  
|10000000 through 10111111|2|  
|11000000 through 11111111|3|  

number of address for interface : 0 = 2<sup>6</sup> = 64  
number of address for interface : 1 = 2<sup>5</sup> = 32  
number of address for interface : 2 = 2<sup>6</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> = 64 + 32 = 96  
number of address for interface : 3 = 2<sup>6</sup> = 64
