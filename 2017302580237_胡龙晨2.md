## Exercises
### T23

(a)Consider a distribution scenario where the server sends files to each client in parallel at the rate of u<sub>s</sub>/N.Due to we suppose u<sub>s</sub>/N<=d<sub>min</sub>, the server sends files at a slower rate than the client per download.Therefore, each client can also receive at the rate of u<sub>s</sub>/N.The time each client receives the entire file is F/(u<sub>s</sub>/N)=NF/u<sub>s</sub>.Since all clients receive files in NF/u<sub>s</sub>, the total distribution time is also NF/u<sub>s</sub>.

(b)Consider a distribution scheme in which the server sends files to each client in parallel at a rate of d<sub>min</sub>.Due to we suppose u<sub>s</sub>/N>=d<sub>min</sub>.Since each client receives at the rate of d<sub>min</sub>, each client receives the entire file in F/d<sub>min<sub>.

(c)D<sub>CS</sub>>=max{NF/u<sub>s</sub>,F/d<sub>min</sub>}  

Suppose u<sub>s</sub>/N<=d<sub>min</sub>, we can get D<sub>CS</sub>>=NF/u<sub>s</sub>

From (a) we can get D<sub>CS</sub><=NF/u<sub>s</sub>, so we get D<sub>CS</sub>=F/d<sub>min</sub> (when u<sub>s</sub>/N>=d<sub>min</sub>)

### T24     

(a)Define u = u<sub>1</sub>+u<sub>2</sub>+...+u<sub>n</sub> . Assuming u<sub>s</sub><=(u<sub>s</sub>+u)/N

Divide the file into N parts, and the i part has the size
